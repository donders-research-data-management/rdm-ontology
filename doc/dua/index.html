<h1>Data Use Agreements</h1>

<p>To share data, analysis pipelines and/or software in a "data sharing collection", the collection manager needs to select a Data Use Agreement (DUA) before publishing a collection. A DUA specifies the conditions and restrictions under which data is shared. For instance, attribution may be required in future publications using the data, or re-sharing of the data may be restricted. In some cases, restrictions are necessary to prevent participant disclosure. Given applicable legislation (for instance GDPR) it is important to select the correct DUA before sharing data.</p>

<p>Several DUAs are described below for sharing (1) potentially identifiable data and (2) non-human/non-identifiable human data. In case your data contains potentially <a href="https://www.ru.nl/privacy/english/protection-personal-data/personal-data/">sensitive information</a>(i.e. information that is competition-sensitive or confidential for individuals, communities, employers) or in case the data has been acquired in an industry-sponsored project, you must contact your <a href="https://ru.nl/donders/research/data">data steward</a> and the RU legal department to make a tailored agreement.</p> 

<p>By selecting a DUA, the collection manager also (implicitly) determines the required access level for external researchers. Specifically, published DSCs can be accessed either (1) following authentication, or (2) anonymously, and the selected DUA determines this, see below.</p><br>

</br>
<p><b>1. Sharing potentially identifiable data</b></p>

<p>In order to protect the privacy of the participants, the Donders Institute / RU have developed a default DUA for sharing potentially identifiable human data. This DUA must be used when data is potentially identifiable:</p>

<p><a href="RU-HD-1.0.html">RU-HD-1.0</a> Radboud University - Radboud University - Human Data 1.0 </p>

<p>When selecting this DUA, external researchers can only access published data after authentication and explicitly agreeing to this DUA. The collection manager can identify external collection users,as they will be added as "viewer" to the collection.</p>

<p><i>What is potentially identifiable data?</i></p>

<p>Some of the data that we acquire is directly identifiable, such as MR-scans, audio, video and photo data. This data must be de-identified before sharing (see <a href="/doc/help/faq/publish-data.html#faq-dsc-prepare">here</a>).</p>

<p>De-identified (audio, video, photo or MRI) data is regarded as potentially identifiable. Also, a combination of background or demographic data could make a dataset potentially identifiable (e.g. gender, age and disease). You need to assess when this is the case. Contact the <a href="https://ru.nl/donders/research/data">data steward</a> in case of doubt.</p>

<p>In exceptional cases in which de-identifying would make the data useless AND for which participants have given consent to share direct identifiable data, it can be allowed to share identifiable data. In these cases, approval by the data steward is required.</p><br>

</br>

<p><b>2. Sharing non-human or non-identifiable human data with anonymous users</b></p>

<p>If you share non-identifiable data, we recommend a more open access, 'general' license. If your non-identifiable data do not require a RU agreement or were acquired outside Radboud University, you can use one of the <a href="https://opendatacommons.org/">OpenDataCommons</a> or <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">CreativeCommons</a> licenses (see below). See <a href="https://creativecommons.org/choose/">here</a> to help make a decision.</p>

<p>Users can anonymously access data publications shared under any of these licenses and (implicitly) accept the terms by downloading the data. Collection managers cannot identify external users of the collection in any way. Data published under any of these licenses must be 100% anonymized (see <a href="/doc/help/faq/publish-data.html#faq-dsc-prepare">here</a>). </p>

If you are only sharing source code of software, simulations or data analysis scripts and not data that originates from actual measurements, you should use a copyright agreement rather than a data use agreement.
For sharing code you can look <a href="https://choosealicense.com">here</a> for guidance in selecting an agreement.

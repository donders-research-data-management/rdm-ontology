The ${repositoryDescription} Glossary
==========================================

Research Data Management (RDM) aims to improve the research **efficiency and transparency**, and to fulfill the **requirements** of the university, funders, and legislation. The ${organizationDescription} uses this repository for data management. The repository serves three purposes:

* **Data preservation** for internal reuse
* **Research documentation** for increasing reusability and reproducibility
* **Data sharing** with the external scientific community

Collections
-----------
The data repository allows a researcher to archive digital data into **collections**. It contains separate collections for preservation, for research documentation and for sharing:

* In a **Data Acquisition Collection** (DAC), the data are archived in their original form. Here, original means without any manipulations that limit future analyses of these data.
* A **Research Documentation Collection** (RDC) documents the process via which data are converted into published results.
* A **Data Sharing Collection** (DSC) contains the data that on which published results are based, allowing external researchers to extend scientific findings by reanalyzing data with new methods, and/or by addressing new research questions using these data.

Authorisation
-------------
Repository users can have different predefined roles in a collection. These roles differ in their rights with respect to the collection:

#. A **manager** can add and remove users to the collection, and can change the role of other users. A manager also has the rights of a contributor.
#. A **contributor** can add, modify and delete files. A contributor also has the rights of a viewer.
#. A **viewer** can view the collection details and content and can download files.

Collections are always initiated by one of the research **administrators** that is part of the ${organizationDescription}'s administrative staff. As a part of the initiation, the research administrator assigns a manager to the collection; typically this is the supervisor of the research project to which this collection belongs. A collection manager can add other users to the collection in the role of manager, and these then obtain the same rights.

The three collections are built at different stages of a research project, see the figure below. For how to request the three collections, please ask your local data steward. Note that an empirical research project can start from existing DACs and/or DSCs, and therefore it is not required that new data have to be acquired for such a project.

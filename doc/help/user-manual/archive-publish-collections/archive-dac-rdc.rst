Archive DAC and RDC
===================

When a research project is completed, the associated :ref:`Data Acquisition Collection (DAC) and/or Research Documentation Collection <faq-collection-types>` should be archived.

.. note:: 

    It is important to archive the DAC as soon as possible after finishing data collection. This will provide a clear endpoint for data collection and it ensures that the DAC becomes read-only and protected against (undesired) changes. The collection  manager can still update user access to archived collections. If necessary, an archived collection can be re-opened and edited in a later stage.  

Only the manager of a collection can archive a collection. To archive a DAC or a RDC, log in to the portal :ref:`(see 1.1) <login-portal>` on your collections page, select the collection you want to archive, and click the button "switch to reviewable internal". This updates the status of the collection to a 'read-only' state that allows colleagues to review its content before archiving.

Details of the collection have to be specified :ref:`see 1.2 <edit-your-collection-details>` before the collection can be archived. The system will give you an error message if some required information is missing.

A collection can be archived if all the required details are specified. Then you can confirm the switch to "reviewable internal".

Now, the status of the current collection is switched from "editable" to "reviewable internal". In this state, the collection is read-only. However, this state is reversible: you can still switch it back to "editable".

This is the state in which you should ask all your collaborators to check whether all the data, scripts etc. are complete. If this is not the case, then you can change the collection's status back to editable by clicking "switch to editable".

If all collaborators agree that the collection is complete, click "switch to archived" and confirm the state change.

.. note::

    Keep in mind that this step is irreversible!

Now the status of the collection is changed from 'reviewable internal' to 'archived'. A permanent read-only copy of the collection is created. In addition, a MANIFEST file is added to the collection data. 

The read-only copy acquires a version number that can be used for future reference. At the end of the details of this collection you will see the version details.

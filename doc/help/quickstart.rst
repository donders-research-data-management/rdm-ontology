Quickstart Guide
================

Welcome to the ${repositoryDescription}. On this page we provide a quick step-by-step guide for Radboud University 
researchers using the ${repositoryName} for the first time. The data repository allows researchers to store digital data into collections, 
which can be seen as digital archiving boxes. In this guide we will show you how to request and work with such a collection.

**Step 1: Create your ${repositoryName} profile**
-------------------------------------------------
Login to the ${repositoryDescription} to create your user profile.

**Note**: If you have not logged in at least once, you cannot request a collection.

To login, click the *login* button at the top right of your screen, then use your Surfconext account to continue and agree to 
the privacy policy. For more extensive help, see :ref:`here <login-portal>`.

You now arrive on a mostly empty page. This is normal, because you have no collections yet. 
You have just created your ${repositoryName} profile and are free to log out at this stage.

**Step 2: Request a collection**
--------------------------------
Now you are ready to request a collection. How you can do this depends on your institute:

* Behavioral Science Institute (BSI)
* `Center of Language Studies (CLS) <https://www.radboudnet.nl/letteren/onderzoek/regelingen-werkprocessen/research-data-management/request-rdr-collection>`_
* Faculty of Law: request a collection by sending an email to Data Steward `Anita BÃ¶cker <mailto:anita.bocker@ru.nl>`_ or to Policy Advisor Research `Kitty van Veelen <mailto:kitty.vanveelen@ru.nl>`_.
* High Field Magnet Laboratory - Free-Electron Lasers for Infrared eXperiments (HFML-FELIX)
* `Institute for Management Research (IMR) <https://www.radboudnet.nl/nsm/research/research-data-management/phase-3-archiving-including-potential-reuse-data/#h32ef576d-ef36-4450-9079-06420d42789d>`_
* `Radboud Institute for Culture and History (RICH) <https://www.radboudnet.nl/letteren/onderzoek/regelingen-werkprocessen/research-data-management/request-rdr-collection>`_
* Radboud Teachers Academy (RTA)

**Step 3: Edit your collection details and add colleagues**
-----------------------------------------------------------
You will receive a confirmation email once your collection has been created. 
When you login to the ${repositoryName} again (see step 1), your collection should be visible under *My collections*. 
We recommend that you add additional information to your collection before working with it:

1. Click on the title of your new collection
2. Click on *Edit metadata* on the top left of your screen 
3. Add any applicable metadata, for example keywords, associated data, and an abstract
4. Optionally, add colleagues to your collection. You can only add colleagues who have an ${repositoryName} profile to your collection (see step 1). 
   Your colleagues can have different roles (manager, contributor or viewer) with different rights. 
   More information can be found :ref:`here <glossary>`.
5. Click on *Save changes* to save the changes

For more extensive help, see :ref:`here <edit-your-collection-details>`. 

**Step 4: Add research data to your collection**
------------------------------------------------
In order to transfer your data to an ${repositoryName} collection, you have to install a WebDAV client. 
This is a one-time installation. 
For windows users, we recommend using :ref:`YodaDrive <YodaDrive>`, 
for MacOS we recommend :ref:`mounting a network drive <mount-network-drive>`. 
Alternatively, Windows and MacOS users can also use :ref:`Cyberduck <cyberduck>`. 
Linux users can choose between :ref:`Thunar <thunar>` and :ref:`Cadaver <cadaver>`.

You are now ready to start working with your first ${repositoryName}-collection!

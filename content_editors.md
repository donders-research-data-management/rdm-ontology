# Editing the configurable content of the Radboud Data Repository portal

This page explains how to update the configurable contents which is displayed on the Radboud Data Repository portal. This includes the help documentation, but also a lot of the the text that is shown on the portal itself.

This repository serves both for the Radboud Data Repository (RDR) as for the Donders Repository (DR). Each of the instances of the repository has two branches, the _acceptance_ and the _release_.  They serve different purposes in the workflow.

## Workflow

Two roles are involved in the workflow: the _content editor_ of rdr which is responsible for updating the contents and bringing it online in rdr. Also the _content manager_ of Donders which is responsible for bringing the change online in dr (when applicable). Hereafter is the workflow:

1. The _content editor_ modifies content, commits to a new _feature_ branch called `rdr-something`, and starts a pull request (to `rdr-release`)
2. The _content editor_ reviews the changes on the acceptance environment and/or asks someone else to review
3. **Optionally**, the content editor asks for a review by a developer
4. The _content editor_ merges the pull request
5. The _content editor_ double checks if itâ€™s ok on the production environment
6. The _content editor_ alerts Donders in the pull request whether they want to add the same changes
7. **Optionally**, The Donders _content manager_ cherry picks selected commits to `dr-acceptance` first to validate the result on the DR acceptance environment. Once accepted, merge `dr-acceptance` to `dr-release`.
8. The _content editor_ deletes the branch when Donders has cherry picked or choosen not to do this

## Build workflow
1. The _RDR buildserver_ check for changes on the repository each 1 minute.
1. In case of success it is deployed to the environment.
1. The outcome of the build is mailed to _content editors_ and _content managers_ selected for that branch.
1. In case of a succesful build the _content editor_ reviews the changes on the acceptance environment.
1. In case of a failed build the _content editor_ tries to resolve the issue themselves or contacts [RDR support](mailto:rdr-support@ru.nl) for support.

The above proces an take 2 minutes in total at max.

## Content management and deployment

Please refer to [this document](content_managers.md) for details.

## How to edit

The configurable contents are organised in GitHub as a git repository, with the following branches:

| Branch         | Role                | Deployed to                    |
| -------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------|
| rdr-acceptance | Content editor      | https://data-acc.ru.nl         |
| rdr-release    | Content manager     | https://data.ru.nl             |
| dr-acceptance  | Content editor      | https://data-acc.donders.ru.nl |
| dr-release     | Content manager     | https://data.donders.ru.nl     |

Before you start editing make sure you're working on the right branch dependent on your role and the environment you need to deploy to. As a content editor __you should only edit the acceptance branch__.

There are two ways of editing the static content:

### method 1

The first edit method is to modifiy the contents directly on the GitHub web interface. Changes made in this way are committed right way to the repository.

### method 2

The second method is to perform changes on a local copy of the repository. With this method, one could edit contents with a favorite text editor; but knowing a couple of basic Git commands is needed.  Follow the instruction below:

Make a local copy of the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Radboud-University/rdr-configurable-content.git
$ cd rdr-configurable-content
```

Edit the files with your favorite text editor.  With this method, changes need to be committed and pushed to GitHub by

```bash
$ git commit -a -m 'message about the change'
$ git push
```

## What to edit

The configurable content to be modified by the content manager are the following type of data:

- __Indices__ are files providing references or elaborated data for the portal to create human-friendly contents at various places in the portal.
- __Snippets__ are files providing part of the HTML body to be incorporated in various portal pages.
- __Styles__ are files used to provide customised style of the portal.
- __Variables__ are placeholders in certain files that will be replaced by the service code with dynamic values when the configurable content is incorporated in the web page.

### indices

The indices files are directly consumed by the portal code to create content dynamically.  Thus, they are presented in a machine-readable format, such as JSON and CSV, in the repository. Given the flexibility of the JSON format, indices in CSV formats are converted into JSON during the deployment process, using the [tools/csv2json.py](https://github.com/Radboud-University/rdr-configurable-content/blob/master/tools/csv2json.py) script.

A list of indices are given blow:

* [doc/associated_material/analysis_tool_identifier_scheme.json](https://github.com/Radboud-University/rdr-configurable-content/blob/master/doc/associated_material/analysis_tool_identifier_scheme.json) contains a list of Persistent Identifiers for specific research tools, each has an abbreviated name of the identifier (`scheme`), full name (`system`), and standard url prefix (`urlPrefix`).

* [doc/associated_material/data_identifier_scheme.json](https://github.com/Radboud-University/rdr-configurable-content/blob/master/doc/associated_material/data_identifier_scheme.json) contains a list of Persistent Identifiers for datasets, each has an abbreviated name of the identifier (`scheme`), full name (`system`), and standard url prefix (`urlPrefix`).

* [doc/associated_material/preregistration_identifier_scheme.json](https://github.com/Radboud-University/rdr-configurable-content/blob/master/doc/associated_material/preregistration_identifier_scheme.json) contains a list of persistent identifiers for preregistrations, each has an abbreviated name of the identifier (`scheme`), full name (`system`), and standard url prefix (`urlPrefix`).

* [doc/associated_material/publication_identifier_scheme.json](https://github.com/Radboud-University/rdr-configurable-content/blob/master/doc/associated_material/publication_identifier_scheme.json) contains a list of persistent identifiers for publications specifically, each has an abbreviated name of the identifier (`scheme`), full name (`system`), and standard url prefix (`urlPrefix`).

* [doc/audiences/audience.json](https://github.com/Radboud-University/rdr-configurable-content/blob/master/doc/audiences/audience.json) contains a list of audiences for which the collections could be interesting, each has a `code` and a `name`.

* [external_urls.json](https://github.com/Radboud-University/rdr-configurable-content/blob/master/external_urls.json) contains links to local contents (i.e. contents provides by this repository) or remote resources (i.e internet resources).  The local contents are specified with `/` followed by a path relative to the repository's directory; while the remote resources are specified with a URI protocol, such as `http://` or `https://`.

* [doc/dua/data_use_agreement.json](https://github.com/Radboud-University/rdr-configurable-content/blob/master/doc/dua/data_use_agreement.json) provides a list of Data Use Agreements, each has its `id`, `name`, and relative `path` to the content.  Note that the `path` is provided as a relative path as the content are provided locally from the repository.  This list is used by the portal to generate the DUA options on the collection editing form of the Data-Sharing Collections.  The order is respected.

* [doc/ethics/ethics_review_board.json](https://github.com/Radboud-University/rdr-configurable-content/blob/master/doc/ethics/ethics_review_board.json) provides a list of Ethical Review Boards, and they are grouped in different categories.  This list is used by the portal to generate the Ethical Review Board options on the collection editing form of the Data-Acquisition Collections.  The order is also respected.

* [doc/publication/publication_systems.json](https://github.com/Radboud-University/rdr-configurable-content/blob/master/doc/publication/publication_systems.json) provids a list of supported resource identifier systems that are used by the portal to generate the Publication System options on the collection editing form of the Data-Sharing Collections.  Each item on the list shoudl consists of the full name (`system`), the short name (`pidType`), and the URL prefix (`urlPrefix`).

* [doc/keyword/MeSH2015.csv](https://github.com/Radboud-University/rdr-configurable-content/blob/master/doc/keyword/MeSH2015.csv) and [doc/keyword/SFN2013.csv](https://github.com/Radboud-University/rdr-configurable-content/blob/master/doc/keyword/SFN2013.csv) are two controlled vocabularies currently supported by the Radboud Data Repository for collection keywords.  They are provided in the CSV format, and will be converted to a JSON format during the deployment.  __For the moment, adding a new keyword set requires development works in the Radboud Data Repository.__

As the JSON documents are imported by the portal code, invalid JSON document can cause errors.  Therefore, all the JSON indices come with a schema file for validating the JSON document during the build process. This process prevents broken JSON indices being deployed to the production system. __One should make sure the schema matches the modified JSON file so that the build process will not fail.__  

### snippets

Snippets are HTML files that will be inserted in relevant portal pages, providing useful information to the portal users.  For a consistent look-n-feel on the portal, one should prevent any CSS-styling in the snippet.

Supported snippets are listed below:

* [doc/login.html](https://github.com/Radboud-University/rdr-configurable-content/blob/master/doc/login.html) contains text to be shown on the portal's login page, after the user clicks on the `LOG IN` button.

* [doc/logout.html](https://github.com/Radboud-University/rdr-configurable-content/blob/master/doc/logout.html) contains text to be shown on the portal after the user logs out the portal.

* [doc/signup.html](https://github.com/Radboud-University/rdr-configurable-content/blob/master/doc/signup.html) contains text to be shown on the portal after the user signed up to the portal the first time.

* [doc/homepage.html](https://github.com/Radboud-University/rdr-configurable-content/blob/master/doc/homepage.html) contains text to be shown on the portal's homepage.

* [doc/footer.html](https://github.com/Radboud-University/rdr-configurable-content/blob/master/doc/footer.html) contains text to be shown on the footer of every portal page.

* [doc/requestaccess.html](https://github.com/Radboud-University/rdr-configurable-content/blob/master/doc/requestaccess.html) contains text guiding user to request data access to a published collection.  The text is used, e.g., in the "Content" tab of the collection detail page.

* [doc/downloadcontent.html](https://github.com/Radboud-University/rdr-configurable-content/blob/master/doc/downloadcontent.html) contains text guiding user to download data via a data access method, such as WebDAV.

* [doc/email/collectionChangesLeadText.html](https://github.com/Radboud-University/rdr-configurable-content/blob/master/doc/email/collectionChangesLeadText.html) provides leading message of the notification email concerning recent collection changes.

* [doc/email/managerLessCollectionsLeadText.html](https://github.com/Radboud-University/rdr-configurable-content/blob/master/doc/email/managerLessCollectionsLeadText.html) provides leading message of the notification email concerning manager-less collections.

* [doc/collection/publish/files_reserved.html](https://github.com/Radboud-University/rdr-configurable-content/blob/master/doc/collection/publish/files_reserved.html) contains text informing user the collection could not be published because it has reserved files.

* [doc/collection/publish/publishing.html](https://github.com/Radboud-University/rdr-configurable-content/blob/master/doc/collection/publish/publishing.html) contains text informing user the collection is being published.

* [doc/collection/publish/readme.txt](https://github.com/Radboud-University/rdr-configurable-content/blob/master/doc/collection/publish/readme.txt) contains the readme file to be added to a collection when published.

* [doc/dua/\*.html](https://github.com/Radboud-University/rdr-configurable-content/blob/master/doc/dua/RU-HD-1.0.html) provides contents of a specific data use agreement.

### styles

Currently, the CSS-style is coded in the portal code.  The only customisable components in style are logo and background.

* [doc/style/logo.png](https://github.com/Radboud-University/rdr-configurable-content/blob/master/doc/style/logo.png): A 100px height logo in png format (logo.png). Width can vary but the height is important to keep the aspect ratio.

* [doc/style/logo@2x.png](https://github.com/Radboud-University/rdr-configurable-content/blob/master/doc/style/logo@2x.png): A 200px height logo in png format for retina screens. Width can vary but the height is important to keep the aspect ratio.

### variables
To make the configurable content more dynamic a number of variables is supported that are replaced by the system with actual values. For instance, the footer text is configurable and displays the software version. The syntax for using variables is as follows: `${variable name}`. For example: `${version}`.
The following variables are supported, which is a combination of variables that can be used everywhere (without context) and ones that are only available within a certain context:

| Variable | Description | Context |

Please be aware that when using variables that do not exist within a certain context the system will not be able to present the corresponding page on the web portal, or send out corresponding emails.

## Images in html
Adding images in html (for exmple /doc/homepage.html) can be done by the following procedure:
Create a hidden rst file (i.e. an rst file that is not being referred to anywhere in any portal help page). Within this file, add rst tags to refer to the image(s). 
This will make the images available under the URL prefix "/doc/help/\_images". For an example, see the hidden rst file https://github.com/Radboud-University/rdr-configurable-content/blob/rdr-acceptance/doc/help/images.rst and its reference in html https://github.com/Radboud-University/rdr-configurable-content/blob/rdr-acceptance/doc/homepage.html.


## Online helps

By making use of the index file [external_urls.json](https://github.com/Radboud-University/rdr-configurable-content/blob/master/external_urls.json), the portal provides a mechanism allowing content manager to link various help buttons in the portal to subject-specific help documents that are hosted externally to the portal. It is achieved by adding a key-value pair in the [external_urls.json](https://github.com/Radboud-University/rdr-configurable-content/blob/master/external_urls.json) with the identifier of the help button as the key, and the link to the help documentation as the value.

### find online help identifiers

The way to find the help-button identifiers is to login to the web portal, and follow the steps below:

1. Goto an page in which you want to add the online helps
1. On the browser's navigation bar, add `&help` to the URL, and reload the page
1. On the reloaded page, hover the mouse on the question marks. The identifier should be shown in the label. The identifier is a dot(`.`)-separated string.  When the link of the online help has already been provided, the question mark will be "activated"; otherwise, it is gray-outed.

### Adding online helps

Once you have found the identifier, modify the two files: 

1. [external_urls.json](https://github.com/Radboud-University/rdr-configurable-content/blob/master/external_urls.json) to specify the URL of the online help identifier.
1. [external_urls.schema](https://github.com/Radboud-University/rdr-configurable-content/blob/master/external_urls.schema) to accept the new attribute for the JSON validation.
